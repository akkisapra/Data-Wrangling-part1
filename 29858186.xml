<title> Structure-property relationships in materials</title>
<synopsis> This unit deals with the mathematical description of physical properties of materials, and their relationship with the underlying microstructure at different length scales. In many materials, including single crystals, textured polycrystals and composites, the physical properties depend on the direction, i.e. they are anisotropic. Describing anisotropy requires proper mathematical tools, as well as an understanding of the material structure at the relevant length scale in order to quantify the property coefficients in various directions. In this unit, we introduce tensors and matrices as mathematical tools to describe anisotropic properties and calculate property relationships in different directions. Material symmetry arguments are introduced to identify the number of independent property coefficients. Mechanical, thermal and electrical properties are systematically investigated (elasticity, electrical permittivity, heat conduction...), including coupled effects (e.g. piezoelectricity, thermal expansion...). Practical problems involving tensor operations are solved using the Python programming language. While there is no formal prerequisite for this unit, basic knowledge in Thermodynamics and Crystallography (MTE 2541 or equivalent), Mechanics of Materials (MTE2546 or equivalent) will be highly beneficial, as well as basic programming skills (ENG1060 or equivalent).</synopsis>

These pillars are used in this unit as they provide an appropriate policy and legislative framework for children and youth at risk and articulate the notion of children's rights. Inter-sectoral integration, the establishment of minimum standards of care, adjustments to legislation and programmatic responses are incorporated in this movement. Students will gain an understanding of the impact legislation has in the child rights' area locally and abroad through the application of case studies. The unit will cover the process of policy development and evaluation and will explore the skills related to the managerial responsibility of supervision. The aim of the unit is to prepare the child and youth care worker for the more strategic macro level responsibility of ensuring that services to children and youth are aligned with policy and legislation through procedural knowledge and supervision skills.</synopsis>

There is an emphasis on person centred care and simulation provides a key platform for learning in this unit. A formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) sits within this unit to assist students' readiness for placement. Students are introduced to the healthcare system and a range of health care settings via an introductory clinical placement. This aims to commence the application of the nutrition care process, the use of food as a therapeutic tool, clinical reasoning, reflection and advanced communication and interpersonal skills required for dietetic practice. Attendance at this placement is compulsory. This unit supports students' progression towards entry level competencies in individual case management in the healthcare setting. Placement may take place outside of regular semester times. Students must have valid police check, WWC check and immunisation certificates in order to participate in clinical placements</synopsis>

<synopsis> The unit deals with the interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslims from the Enlightenment era to the contemporary period. The historical relationship between these three religious or ethnic groups has sparked considered historical debate and popular misunderstanding. This unit will unpack some of these common assumptions by tracing the evolving relationship between Christians, Muslims, and Jews across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The unit will begin by tracing Enlightenment debates about tolerance and difference that centred around the place of the Jews in modern European nation-states. It will then shift to discussing the social and economic positions of Jews and Muslims in 19th century North Africa, as well as the socio-economic mobility of Jews in 19th century Europe. It will finally move into the twentieth century and cover topics including the emergence of Zionism, the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel, decolonization and the emigration of North African Jews and Muslims to Europe, and contemporary debates about difference in 21st century Europe.</synopsis>

This unit promotes an examination of Indigenous cultural productions from an Indigenous viewpoint and lens, which enables students to experience not only an acquisition of content of Indigenous practice but through a unique methodological Indigenous approach. Students examine historical and recent cultural productions to learn about their significance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait culture, society and its knowledge economy and its relationship to the broader Australian historical, cultural and political space. Lectures and tutorials provide students with necessary knowledge and a platform to engage with this knowledge in an appropriately ethnographical and experiential way. These lectures provide insight in to Indigenous production in context of pre-colonial history, an imagined post-colonial trajectory through to its interactivity with de-colonisation and the onset of new materialism. Students will develop a deep understanding of the relationality that Indigenous culture has with the premise of Country, its impact on practice and its relationship to their own place and situated experience.</synopsis>

<title> Italian transformations: Reading and writing self-discovery</title>
<synopsis> The unit will explore a selection of fiction and non-fiction texts that treat Italy as a site for transformations of the self. These self-discoveries are usually cast as positive but are on occasion of a more unsettling or disturbing kind. The unit will  investigate why Italy has been a key site  of renewal and 'undoing' in literature and will track the changes in the way such transformations of the self have been achieved. It will also account for the popularity of such narratives with readers past and present. In this unit there will be an emphasis on 'geo-located' reading experiences and writing exercises. For this reason there will be a particular focus on 'Tuscan transformations'; we will visit the actual sites and scenes of our texts and there will also be regular in situ writing excursions in Prato and surrounds.</synopsis>

<title> Indigenous justice in Australia</title>
<synopsis> The unit introduces students to issues of Indigenous justice and injustice in Australia. This unit focuses on critically understanding the relationship between colonialism in Australia, Indigenous Law and systems of justice and contemporary concerns of injustice. By understanding the role of the criminal justice system in histories of Australian colonialism, students will learn how the criminal justice system has attempted to manage Aboriginal people from the European settlement into the present. Considering crime and criminal justice through a settler-colonial lens, students will learn from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices about experiences of crime and criminal justice, emerging trends in Indigenous justice and consider ways to improve and 'decolonise' current forms of criminal justice. Drawing upon Indigenous perspectives and critical inter-disciplinary work, students will examine topics such as: Indigenous customary law, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, mandatory sentencing practices, and the policing of public space, language in court systems and Koori courts.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Europe is the birthplace of cinema, and from the silent era through to Italian neo-realism, to the new waves of the 1960s and 70s, European cinema changed the way we see and know the world. In this unit we trace the development of European cinema after the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the 21st century, asking three key questions: How have the changing boundaries and social crises in Europe in the post-Berlin Wall era impacted on cinema? What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity. Students will be introduced to films from a range of countries, including France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Spain.</synopsis>

These modes of inquiry underline the full cycle of a research process: from identifying a research topic, mapping research design, generating and analysing data to writing-up and disseminating research findings. Feminist and queer methodologies or theoretical frameworks underpinning research would critically consider aspects such as: identifying research gaps with a view to giving voice to the narratives of marginalised communities (e.g. gender and sexual minorities); grounding research in their lived realities and in specific social-cultural contexts; and practising reflexivity when faced with ethical dilemmas, engaging and representing the 'other' and interpreting, writing up and disseminating data.</synopsis>

<title> Web fundamentals</title>
<synopsis> The world-wide web is one of the most widely-used platforms for building applications. Although all students can be assumed to be experienced users of the web, very few have any clear understanding of the technologies upon which the web is based, and the way in which these technologies affect web-based applications. This unit aims to give students a sound basic knowledge of the web and a range of issues which may be involved in web application development. It will take a strongly practical focus in examining the technology, design and implementation problems a developer needs to address in developing applications for real-world systems. The diversity of web applications means that there are a wide range of issues which may be relevant to the development of any given web site. The unit will aim to give breadth of coverage of these issues, rather than focusing in depth on any particular development task or any specific type of web application.</synopsis>

<synopsis> The media is one of the most important components of any political society. In a liberal democracy like Australia, its role and function have profound implications for the conduct of politics, the nature of democracy and public policy outcomes. In this unit, the relationship between the media, politics and public policy is studied from three broad perspectives. First, the politics of the media is investigated from the perspective of liberal democratic theory in order to understand the role of news media on the policy debate. Second, the political economy of the media is investigated. Particular emphasis is on the structure and operation of media organisations and journalists and how political news is covered. Third, the unit undertakes a study of the relationship between the media and political actors. Particular emphasis is on the use of public relations and 'spin doctors' in managing the media as well as the utilisation of political advertising and strategic political communication by governments and political agents.</synopsis>

The unit will pay particular attention to the complex representation of gender and sexuality in the period.

<title> Brand management</title>
<synopsis> A brand is much more than a logo, a symbol, a sign or device, or simply the result of clever advertising. It helps to communicate value and create and deliver that value. Branding is a promise of value for customers. It helps to attract and, if it is true and accurate, keep customers. It provides an extra element of understanding or meaning, for customers as they form opinions and make purchase decisions from a variety of competing offerings. There is strong industry demand for graduates with a thorough understanding of branding. While this unit is primarily for students undertaking a major in marketing it is offered to any student with a prerequisite of an introductory marketing unit.</synopsis>

<title> Indigenous Australian art, practice and ways of knowing</title>
<synopsis> This unit offers students a synopsis of Indigenous Australian art and practice as a vehicle for the production of knowledge. This unit promotes an examination of Indigenous cultural productions from an Indigenous viewpoint and lens, which enables students to experience not only an acquisition of content of Indigenous practice but through a unique methodological Indigenous approach. Students examine historical and recent cultural productions to learn about their significance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait culture, society and its knowledge economy and its relationship to the broader Australian historical, cultural and political space. Lectures and tutorials provide students with necessary knowledge and a platform to engage with this knowledge in an appropriately ethnographical and experiential way. These lectures provide insight in to Indigenous production in context of pre-colonial history, an imagined post-colonial trajectory through to its interactivity with de-colonisation and the onset of new materialism. Students will develop a deep understanding of the relationality that Indigenous culture has with the premise of Country, its impact on practice and its relationship to their own place and situated experience.</synopsis>

<title> Biomedical basis and epidemiology of human disease</title>
<synopsis> This unit will have a combined approach and examine the biomedical and epidemiological impacts of human disease on society. It will concentrate on the pathobiological and biomedical basis of prevalent human disease processes. Relevant areas examined in this unit may change from year to year but will generally include immune and inflammatory diseases, (e.g. inflammatory renal and joint disease); cancer biology (focussing on mechanisms of tumour spread); cardiovascular biology, (coronary heart disease/cerebrovascular disease); diabetes, obesity and neurological diseases. Disease pathogenesis, including lessons gained from cell/molecular biology and disease models will be the major focus. Concurrently, the epidemiological/clinical features of each disease, current treatments, challenges and future treatment prospects, including clinical trials will be covered highlighting the importance of an evidence-based approach to health care. This will discuss the complexities behind treatment based decision making by reviewing the evidence- base and understanding the criteria for deciding on what is best evidence. This unit will consider the biomedical basis and epidemiology in the context of the Australian health care system, including the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), health policy and service delivery systems, putting illness and health in the context of social, cultural and behavioural systems.</synopsis>

Students will examine concepts and theories that underpin health promotion and the primary care, behavioural and socio-environmental approaches used in this field. Important dimensions of practice, including partnerships, participation, multi-level action, capacity building and evidence-based practice will be explored. The areas of health promotion action that will be examined will encompass policy development for health, creating supportive environments, health education strategies, health communication techniques at the group and population level, and advocacy. The application of these to health challenges in diverse cultural and economic contexts will be explored. By the completion of the Unit, students will be expected to demonstrate an understanding of health promotion's key concepts, values and methods, and the criteria by which the quality of practice can be judged.</synopsis>

<title> Visual practices 3</title>
<synopsis> This unit is the last and culminating unit in the Visual Practices sequence and is second of the two third year units. In this unit emphasis is placed on independent cultural research and its relation to a broader collaborative or group context in the public realm. Students develop a creative, expressive and critical project that utilises advanced conceptualisation and material manipulation, engaging with the artwork as part of a chain of production, reception, distribution and publics. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their evolving cultural practice and professional direction. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts and their publication in the written form as a supplement to the student's Visual Practice. Detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place primarily through personal tuition with lecturers, peer-based critique and experimenting with various modes of public presentation. This unit provides a stimulating and supportive environment through the introduction of a supervised studio and bridges this to independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. This unit contextualises individual practice within various public platforms that require different modes of group and/or collaborative modes of engagement. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as cultural producer in broad array of Visual Arts disciplines, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.</synopsis>

<title> Fashion interfaces: communication and the interior</title>
<synopsis> Knowledge of the fashion systems that underpin communication and interior design practice provides designers with a critical understanding of how their images and objects operate within society. This unit investigates interdisciplinary approaches to communication design and the interior through the framework of fashion theory. Focussing on issues of social and cultural identity, gender and consumer culture students will undertake a research-informed visualisation project that explores the relationship between fashion and their discipline. By integrating conceptual and critical approaches to fashion, communication and the interior students will develop their ability to interface their individual design practice with fashion images, spaces and identity creation.</synopsis>

<title> From Alexander to Kleopatra: The rise and fall of the Hellenistic world</title>
<synopsis> Alexander the Great expanded Macedonia from a small north Aegean kingdom to a huge territory stretching from the Danube to the Himalayas. After Alexander's death, that empire disintegrated into a series of warring kingdoms, initially ruled by Alexander's generals. Egypt, ruled by Ptolemy and his successors, became the centre of one of the most enduring of these Hellenistic kingdoms, lasting for nearly three centuries until the reign of Kleopatra VII, who struggled in vain to preserve her kingdom in the face of Roman expansion. This unit focuses on the world created by Alexander and the Ptolemies. Themes include the nature of Alexander's rule and that of the Ptolemies, the heterogeneous culture that developed as a result of Greco-Macedonian occupation, the problems faced by Kleopatra and her Ptolemaic predecessors with the growing threat of Roman power, the rivalry between and among ruling dynasties, and the ways in which the indigenous Egyptian culture flourished and adapted to the profound changes it experienced. This unit analyses archaeological, literary, and documentary sources to provide an interdisciplinary study of a time of unprecedented change in the ancient world.</synopsis>

<title> Brand management</title>
<synopsis> A brand is much more than a logo, a symbol, a sign or device, or simply the result of clever advertising. It helps to communicate value and create and deliver that value. Branding is a promise of value for customers. It helps to attract and, if it is true and accurate, keep customers. It provides an extra element of understanding or meaning, for customers as they form opinions and make purchase decisions from a variety of competing offerings. There is strong industry demand for graduates with a thorough understanding of branding. While this unit is primarily for students undertaking a major in marketing it is offered to any student with a prerequisite of an introductory marketing unit.</synopsis>

<title> Indigenous Australian art, practice and ways of knowing</title>
<synopsis> This unit offers students a synopsis of Indigenous Australian art and practice as a vehicle for the production of knowledge. This unit promotes an examination of Indigenous cultural productions from an Indigenous viewpoint and lens, which enables students to experience not only an acquisition of content of Indigenous practice but through a unique methodological Indigenous approach. Students examine historical and recent cultural productions to learn about their significance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait culture, society and its knowledge economy and its relationship to the broader Australian historical, cultural and political space. Lectures and tutorials provide students with necessary knowledge and a platform to engage with this knowledge in an appropriately ethnographical and experiential way. These lectures provide insight in to Indigenous production in context of pre-colonial history, an imagined post-colonial trajectory through to its interactivity with de-colonisation and the onset of new materialism. Students will develop a deep understanding of the relationality that Indigenous culture has with the premise of Country, its impact on practice and its relationship to their own place and situated experience.</synopsis>

<title> Modern Italian political thought</title>
<synopsis> The unit surveys Italian political thought &#38; practice from the Renaissance to the New Millennium. It aims to give students a clear understanding of modern &#38; contemporary Italian political ideas, culture and institutions. It begins by examining Italian political thinkers, diplomats, and activists' seminal contribution to Renaissance, Enlightenment and Modern political theories and movements. It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises &#38; revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.</synopsis>

<title> Translational research</title>
<synopsis> Translational research is a growing and exciting new discipline in medicine that deals with the development of fundamental scientific findings into tangible clinical outcomes. Translational researchers are involved in identifying a worthwhile scientific finding that can be applied to a clinical setting. Along this research and development pipeline are a series of critical check-points that provide the investigator vital tools to generate a valuable result that has merit for translation. This unit will establish a fundamental knowledge in the processes involved in developing a basic science finding through to clinical studies. The unit provides workshop-based learning in the development of discipline-specific laboratory research questions and how they are applied to broader clinical applications. The main focus of this unit is to identify how fundamental scientific questions may have multidisciplinary clinical answers. Other core learning outcomes are through understanding how scientific concepts can be marketed and communicated effectively through research pipeline procedures and the responsibilities of the researcher that may be derived from this.</synopsis>

<title> Reading the past</title>
<synopsis> The unit is about how and why we read literature from the past. It addresses the 'foreignness' of Early Modern literature and the challenge of becoming an informed and engaged reader of that literature. The unit will explore both the aesthetic distance between Early Modern writing and the present - what does it mean, for example, to characterize a text as Baroque, or Mannerist, or Gothic, and how appropriate are such terms? - and the thematic concerns of the period itself: its anxious questions about the nature and limits of the human, for example, that were opened up by the breakdown of medieval theological certainty and the rise of science.  Such questions will be posed in terms of the political and ideological context of the time: broadly, the gradual but alarming transformation of a static feudal hierarchy into the fluid social order of capitalism, and the challenges posed by (some) women to the limiting assumptions of institutionalized patriarchy.</synopsis>

<title> Russia and the US: Comparative politics</title>
<synopsis> The subject examines the domestic politics of Russia and United States. Both countries are two of the most powerful and influential countries within the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Developing knowledge of Russian and American politics and societies, students will enhance their understanding of the dynamics of governing ethnically and religiously diverse societies with many competing-and at times sharply antagonistic-interests, and countries with substantial military and economic prowess. The unit closely analyses both countries' political cultures, electoral politics, political institutions and contemporary social issues (i.e., debates over gender and minority rights), and struggles with extremism and terrorism. Notably, the subject addresses the extent to which Russia's conception of 'Sovereign Democracy' and the US' 'American Exceptionalism' influence how Russian and American citizens (and politicians) view themselves and their countries' status in the world, and if this makes them unique as powerful states, or whether their political behaviour and sense of national identity and destiny are common amongst modern nation-states. Upon completing the subject, students should have also developed a nuanced grasp of the broader field of comparative politics, and its main conceptual approaches and interpretive frameworks-to complement their knowledge of Russian and US politics.</synopsis>
